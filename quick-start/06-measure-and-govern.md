# Step 6. Measure and govern

Use the knowledge graph to observe and improve content quality.

Examples:

- Detect orphaned entities
- Identify overused or unused relationship types
- Monitor graph growth and complexity

This feedback loop ensures that KGS remains a governed semantic system rather than a static annotation scheme.

## Example governance metrics

| Metric                 | Description                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Orphan rate            | Percentage of entities with no inbound or outbound relationships |
| Relationship density   | Average number of relationships per entity                       |
| Broken reference count | Number of unresolved identifiers                                 |
| Vocabulary drift       | Number of non-approved relationship types in use                 |

These are Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-bound (SMART) governance indicators.
